			<div class="panel">
				 <p><i>Catching Fire</i> is the second book in <i>The Hunger Games</i> trilogy by Suzanne Collins. It picks up where <i>The Hunger Games</i> left off, following Katniss Everdeen’s victory in the 74th Hunger Games. Her defiant act of rebellion—pretending to be in love with her fellow victor, Peeta Mellark, to avoid both of them being killed—sparks unrest in the districts of Panem. <br><br>

					As Katniss and Peeta return home to District 12, they are thrust into a new role as symbols of rebellion, much to their discomfort. President Snow threatens Katniss, warning her that she must continue to feign a romantic relationship with Peeta or else her loved ones will be in danger.<br><br>

				To quell the growing unrest, Snow announces the 75th Hunger Games, known as the Quarter Quell, which forces previous victors to return to the arena. Katniss and Peeta are once again thrust into a brutal, deadly competition, facing new challenges and alliances in a specially designed arena that’s full of deadly traps and twists. Throughout the games, Katniss’s defiance continues to inspire the districts, setting the stage for a revolution against the Capitol.<br><br>

				The story explores themes of power, sacrifice, and survival, as Katniss becomes a reluctant symbol of resistance while grappling with the cost of her actions and the complexity of her feelings for both Peeta and her longtime friend, Gale.</p>

	<button class="accordion">Main Character</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p><b>Katniss Everdeen</b><br>  
		   The protagonist of the story, Katniss is a strong-willed and resourceful 17-year-old girl from District 12. After surviving the 74th Hunger Games, she becomes the face of rebellion in the districts of Panem. Throughout *Catching Fire*, she struggles with her role as a symbol of resistance, as well as with the emotional complexities of her relationships with Peeta and Gale.<br><br>

		<b>Peeta Mellark</b> <br>
		   Peeta is the charming and brave boy from District 12 who, along with Katniss, won the 74th Hunger Games. In *Catching Fire*, Peeta remains deeply devoted to Katniss and continues to play along with their public romance. His loyalty and love for Katniss are unwavering, even as he faces the emotional and physical toll of the games. He’s also a skilled strategist and manipulator, capable of using the media and his persona to his advantage.<br><br>

		<b>Gale Hawthorne</b> <br>
		   Gale is Katniss’s best friend and hunting partner from District 12. He is strong, fiercely loyal, and shares a deep bond with Katniss, though their relationship becomes strained as the story progresses. Gale is passionate about resisting the Capitol and advocates for active rebellion, often conflicting with Katniss’s reluctance to get involved in larger political movements.<br><br>

		<b>President Coriolanus Snow</b> <br>
		   The antagonist of the series, President Snow is the cruel and manipulative leader of the Capitol. He views Katniss as a threat to his power and seeks to control her, using threats and intimidation to keep her in line. Snow is a master of political manipulation and will go to any lengths to preserve the Capitol’s hold over Panem.<br><br>

		<b>Effie Trinket</b>  <br>
		   Effie is the Capitol-appointed escort for District 12’s tributes. She is eccentric, always well-dressed in extravagant outfits, and has a rigid sense of manners. Despite her Capitol allegiance, Effie becomes more emotionally invested in Katniss and Peeta’s well-being over time and shows a side of concern for them.<br><br>

		<b>Haymitch Abernathy</b><br>
		   Haymitch is District 12’s only living Hunger Games victor, and he serves as the mentor for Katniss and Peeta. Though he’s a heavy drinker and often appears cynical, Haymitch is extremely clever and understands the Capitol’s manipulative nature. He is a crucial ally in helping Katniss and Peeta navigate the complexities of the games and their role in the rebellion.<br><br>

		<b>Cinna</b><br>
		   Cinna is Katniss’s stylist, responsible for her public image. His quiet, thoughtful nature contrasts with the extravagant Capitol, and he genuinely cares about Katniss. Cinna plays a key role in shaping Katniss's persona as the "Mockingjay," and he helps her make powerful statements through her appearances, especially in the lead-up to the Quarter Quell.<br><br>

		<b>Prim Everdeen</b>  <br>
		   Katniss’s younger sister, Prim is kind, gentle, and the reason Katniss originally volunteered for the Hunger Games. Prim’s safety and well-being are a driving force for Katniss, and her relationship with her sister remains a central emotional anchor throughout the story.<br><br>

		<b>Finnick Odair</b>  <br>
		   Finnick is a charismatic and skilled victor from District 4, who becomes one of Katniss’s allies during the Quarter Quell. Despite his flirtatious demeanor, Finnick has a complex past, and he reveals his vulnerabilities as the story unfolds, particularly his struggles with the Capitol's control over him.<br><br>

		<b>Johanna Mason</b>  <br>
		   Johanna is another victor from District 7 who participates in the Quarter Quell. She is tough, independent, and fiercely unapologetic. Johanna has a sharp wit and can be brutally honest, but she is also a victim of the Capitol's manipulation and control. Her unorthodox behavior makes her both a threat and an ally.<br><br>

		<b>Beetee</b>  <br>
		   Beetee is a victor from District 3, known for his intelligence and expertise in electronics and technology. He plays a crucial role in the strategy of the 75th Hunger Games, using his technological skills to aid Katniss and her allies in the arena.<br><br>

		<b>Wiress</b>  <br>
		   Wiress is Beetee’s partner and a victor from District 3. She is quiet and slightly eccentric, often speaking in cryptic phrases. Wiress plays an important role in understanding the arena’s design, which becomes key to the group’s survival during the Quarter Quell.<br><br>

	<button class="accordion">Fun Facts</button>
		<div class="panel">
				1. <b>Director Change</b>: <i>Catching Fire</i> was directed by Francis Lawrence, who replaced Gary Ross from the first film. Lawrence had previously directed *I Am Legend* and *Constantine*. His vision for the film was key in bringing a darker, more intense tone to the movie compared to the first.<br><br>

				2. <b>Filming Locations</b>: While much of the <i>Hunger Games</i> series was filmed in North Carolina, <i>Catching Fire</i> also featured unique filming locations. The filming of the Quarter Quell arena scenes took place in Hawaii, with some sequences shot on the island of Oahu. The lush, tropical landscapes helped to create a vivid contrast to the dreary, oppressive world of the Capitol and Districts.<br><br>

				3. <b>The Mockingjay Pin</b>: The iconic Mockingjay pin, which becomes Katniss's symbol of rebellion, was designed by a professional jeweler. In the movie, it's subtly different from the book's description—its design was slightly altered to better fit the visual style of the film and to give it a more intricate, detailed look.<br><br>

				4. <b>Jennifer Lawrence's Physical Training</b>: Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) underwent intense physical training for her role, including archery practice, stunt training, and weight lifting. She trained for several months to ensure her character was physically prepared for the action scenes, and her skill with the bow became one of the standout elements of Katniss's persona.<br><br>

				5. <b>Real Fire for Special Effects</b>: In the arena scenes, where fire is a prominent feature, the filmmakers used actual fire for special effects. This helped create a more realistic and dramatic atmosphere, though it was a challenge to ensure the safety of the cast and crew during these sequences.<br><br>
