			<div class="panel">
				 <p><i>The Hunger Games</i> is the first book in Suzanne Collins' dystopian trilogy. The story is set in Panem, a nation located in what was once North America, which is divided into 12 districts and controlled by the Capitol. To maintain control over the districts, the Capitol holds an annual event called the Hunger Games, where each district must send one boy and one girl (called tributes) to fight in a televised, battle-to-the-death competition.<br><br>

				The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, lives in District 12, the poorest of the districts. When her younger sister, Prim, is selected as the female tribute for the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers in her place to protect her. She is joined by Peeta Mellark, the male tribute from her district, who has a complicated history with Katniss—he once saved her life by giving her bread when her family was starving.<br><br>

				Once they arrive in the Capitol, Katniss and Peeta are prepared for the Games by their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, a former victor from District 12, and their stylist, Cinna. The Games themselves take place in a large, deadly arena designed by the Capitol, full of traps, dangers, and other tributes who are fighting for survival. Katniss uses her skills as an archer and her resourcefulness to navigate the Games.<br><br>

				As the Games progress, Katniss and Peeta form a strong bond, and Peeta reveals that he has been in love with Katniss for years. To gain the audience's favor (and thus the sponsorship needed for survival), they play up a romantic relationship, creating a compelling narrative for the Capitol viewers. This strategy allows them to survive longer than expected.<br><br>

				In a twist at the end of the Games, Katniss and Peeta both threaten to eat poisonous berries, refusing to kill each other, which would leave the Capitol with no victor. The Capitol relents, and they are both crowned winners. However, their defiance and the idea that they could challenge the Capitol set the stage for rebellion across the districts.</p>

	<button class="accordion">Main Character</button>
		<div class="panel">
		  <p>1. <b>Katniss Everdeen</b>  
  				Katniss is the 16-year-old protagonist and the narrator of the story. She is resourceful, strong-willed, and independent, having grown up in District 12, the poorest of Panem’s districts. Katniss is skilled with a bow and arrow, and her survival instincts are sharp due to years of hunting to provide for her family. After volunteering to take her sister Prim’s place in the Hunger Games, Katniss becomes a symbol of defiance and rebellion against the Capitol. She struggles with her emotions, particularly her relationships with Peeta and Gale, and her role as a pawn in a larger political game.<br><br>
			
			2. <b>Peeta Mellark</b>  
			   Peeta is Katniss’s fellow tribute from District 12. He is strong, kind-hearted, and deeply in love with Katniss, though she initially doesn’t fully understand or reciprocate his feelings. Peeta is also a skilled baker and uses his charm and intelligence to navigate the Games. His strategic thinking helps him survive, and his love for Katniss becomes central to their story. Over the course of the Games, Peeta proves his loyalty to Katniss and their relationship becomes crucial to both their survival and the audience's emotional investment.<br><br>

			3. <b>Gale Hawthorne</b>  
			   Gale is Katniss’s best friend and hunting partner in District 12. He shares her deep sense of rebellion against the Capitol and often discusses how to fight back against the system. Gale is strong, loyal, and has a deep connection with Katniss, which complicates their friendship as she becomes closer to Peeta during the Games. Gale represents Katniss’s past and the simpler life they had before the Hunger Games, but his increasingly radical views about revolution lead to tensions in their relationship.<br><br>

			4. <b>Effie Trinket</b>  
			   Effie is the Capitol-appointed escort for District 12’s tributes. She is eccentric, colorful, and always dressed in extravagant outfits, with her primary role being to keep Katniss and Peeta in line for their public appearances. Though initially seen as a symbol of Capitol excess, Effie’s character evolves, and she becomes more caring and emotionally invested in Katniss and Peeta as the story progresses.<br><br>

			5. <b>Haymitch Abernathy</b>  
			   Haymitch is the only living victor from District 12, and he serves as the mentor to Katniss and Peeta during the Hunger Games. Haymitch is sarcastic, cynical, and often drunk, but beneath his rough exterior, he is highly intelligent and deeply cares about his tributes. He has a complex understanding of the Capitol and the Games, and his advice is key to Katniss and Peeta’s survival. Haymitch represents a more jaded, hardened view of life under the Capitol’s rule.<br><br>

			6. <b>Cinna</b>  
			   Cinna is Katniss’s stylist, tasked with designing her outfits for the Games and public appearances. His quiet, thoughtful demeanor makes him stand out among the Capitol’s flamboyant citizens. Cinna forms a bond with Katniss and believes in her ability to inspire change. He plays a key role in shaping Katniss's image as the "Girl on Fire," which becomes symbolic of rebellion and hope to the districts.<br><br>

			7. <b>Prim Everdeen</b>  
			   Prim is Katniss’s younger sister, and her safety is the driving force behind Katniss's decision to volunteer for the Hunger Games in the first place. Prim is kind, gentle, and intelligent, representing innocence and a sense of hope in contrast to the violence and oppression surrounding her. She is Katniss’s greatest motivation, and Katniss is fiercely protective of her.<br><br>

			8. <b>President Coriolanus Snow</b>  
			   President Snow is the authoritarian ruler of Panem and the primary antagonist in the series. He is manipulative, cruel, and seeks to maintain control over the districts through fear and violence. Snow views Katniss as a threat to his power, especially after her defiance in the Games, and he will stop at nothing to suppress any signs of rebellion.<br><br>

			9. <b>Glimmer</b> 
			   Glimmer is the female tribute from District 1, and she is portrayed as a glamorous and attractive young woman, heavily trained for the Games. She is one of the tributes Katniss must face in the arena. Glimmer’s vanity contrasts with Katniss's practical nature.<br><br>

			  10.<b>Marvel</b> 
			   Marvel is the male tribute from District 1, known for being physically strong and an expert fighter. He is one of Katniss’s primary threats in the arena, although he ultimately becomes a victim of the Games’ brutal nature.<br><br>

			11. <b>Rue</b>  
			   Rue is the female tribute from District 11 and becomes Katniss’s ally in the arena. She is small, quick, and resourceful, with a gentle, trusting nature. Rue’s death becomes one of the most emotional and pivotal moments in the book, symbolizing the innocence lost in the Games and deepening Katniss’s resolve to fight against the Capitol.<br><br>

			12. <b>Cato</b>  
			   Cato is the male tribute from District 2, known for his brutal strength and aggressive nature. He emerges as one of Katniss’s fiercest opponents in the Games. Cato represents the Capitol’s ideal of the perfect tribute—strong, ruthless, and willing to do whatever it takes to win.</p>

	<button class="accordion">Fun Facts</button>
		<div class="panel">
			1. <b>Inspiration for the Story</b>: Suzanne Collins was inspired to write *The Hunger Games* after channel surfing one night. She flipped between a reality TV show and coverage of the Iraq War. This juxtaposition sparked the idea of a dystopian world where a televised battle for survival becomes a form of entertainment, blending the violence of war with the voyeurism of reality television.<br><br>

			2. <b>Casting of Jennifer Lawrence</b>: Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Katniss Everdeen, was relatively unknown before landing the role. The producers were initially concerned about her age (she was 20, while Katniss is 16 in the book), but they were won over by her intense audition. Lawrence's strong presence and dedication to the character helped her secure the role, and her performance turned her into an international star.<br><br>

			3. <b>Katniss’s Archery Skills</b>: Jennifer Lawrence trained for several months in archery to prepare for her role as Katniss. She worked with expert archery instructors and practiced several hours a day. By the end of her training, she was able to shoot arrows with impressive accuracy and speed, which added to the authenticity of her portrayal of Katniss.<br><br>

			4. <b>Realistic Hunger Games Arena</b>: The arena where the Hunger Games take place in the movie was designed to look natural and realistic. Filming took place in North Carolina, with many of the outdoor shots taking place in the forests of the Appalachian Mountains. The filmmakers used the natural terrain to enhance the immersive experience of the arena.<br><br>

			5. <b>Lionsgate’s Early Commitment</b>: Before the movie even started production, Lionsgate, the studio behind the film, was confident in its potential. They secured the movie rights to Suzanne Collins’ book in 2009, which was a bold move considering the book had yet to become a global sensation. However, the studio’s foresight paid off, as the film became a massive success.
